## Compatibility notes
This library:
- [...] uses [the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch). Versions of Node.js that do not support `fetch()` may instead use [`node-fetch` and make it globally accessible](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch#providing-global-access).
- [...] is an ES module and doesn't support CommonJS syntax.
- [...] was written so it can be run without transpiling in:
  - Latest Chromium
  - Latest Gecko
  - Latest WebKit
  - Latest Node.js _(+ latest Node.js LTS with `node-fetch`)_
