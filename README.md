## Getting started

### Installation as a dependency
You may use `npm` or your favorite JavaScript package manager to install `perma-js-sdk` as a dependency.

```bash
npm install @harvard-lil/perma-js-sdk
```

### Directly in the browser
This library can be imported directly in the browser.<br>
You may use a service such as [`unpkg.com`](https://unpkg.com) to import its latest version from `npmjs.org`. 

```javascript
import { PermaAPI } from "https://unpkg.com/@harvard-lil/perma-js-sdk@latest/index.js";
```

### Quick Example
Here a quick example of how to use the `PermaAPI` class to interact with [Perma.cc's API](https://perma.cc).<br>
See the [API Documentation](#api-documentation) for details.

```javascript
import { PermaAPI } from "perma-js-sdk";

try {
  const api = new PermaAPI(API_KEY);
  const archive = await api.createArchive("https://lil.harvard.edu");
  console.log(`Archive created -- guid: ${archive.guid}`);
}
catch(err) {
  // ...
}
```

## Stack and compatibility

### Stack
This library, by design, has no runtime dependency and does not _require_ a build step in most cases.<br> 

### Compatibility notes
This library:
- [...] uses [the Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).<br>Versions of Node.js that do not support `fetch()` may instead use [`node-fetch` and make it globally accessible](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch#providing-global-access).
- [...] is ES module-based and doesn't support CommonJS syntax.
- [...] was written so it can be run without transpiling in:
  - Latest Chromium
  - Latest Gecko
  - Latest WebKit
  - Latest Node.js _(+ latest Node.js LTS with `node-fetch`)_

## API documentation

### Reference
- [`PermaAPI` class documentation](/doc/index.md) _(Automatically generated)_
- [Associated types documentation](/doc/types.md) _(Automatically generated)_

### Notes
- This project uses [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) and is compatible with IntelliSense (Examples: [[1]](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/625889/177423585-f92c491e-d98c-4476-8250-544d535b6ecc.png) [[2]](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/625889/177424359-23906796-1c62-418e-996a-f0265c1f6be6.png)).

## Environment variables

### Scope: Integration tests
The following environment variables are only used in the context of [the integration tests suite](#testing).

| Name | Required? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TESTS_API_KEY` | Yes | API key to be used to perform integration tests. |
| `TESTS_FORCE_BASE_URL` | No | Base API url to be used to perform integration tests. If not set, will default to `https://api.perma.cc`. |

## CLI Commands

### docgen
```bash
npm run docgen
```

Refreshes files under `/doc` using `JSDoc` comments in `index.js` and `types.js`.

### test-unit
```bash
npm run test-unit
```

Runs `index.unit.test.js` using Jest.

### test-integration
```bash
npm run test-integration
```

Runs `index.integration.test.js` using Jest.<br> 
This test suite requires the `TESTS_API_KEY` and `TESTS_FORCE_BASE_URL` environment variables to be set.

### test-integration-local
```bash
npm run test-integration-local
```

Same as `test-integration` but: 
- Reads environment variables from `.env` file if available
- Ignores TLS certificates errors _(so the tests can be run against a local instance of the Perma API)_

## Publishing a new version

Once changes have been merged to `develop` and a new version is ready, please follow these steps to deploy a new version of the package:
- `npm run test-unit`: To double check that all tests pass
- `npm run test-integration-local`: _(Same)_
- `npm run docgen`: Update documentation
- `npm version minor --no-git-tag-version`:  Will update the package version without creating a commit
- `npm publish --access public`: Will release 
- **Commit and push changes to:** `develop`
- **PR and merge to:** `main`

You will need access to the `@harvard-lil` organization on `npmjs.org` to publish new versions of the package.
